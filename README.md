# GCoh

This repository implements the classical global coherence, and uses the timeseries of eigenvectors obtained to find fleeting patterns of a group of coherent EEG channels.

Here :point_right:
<A href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/AraiKensuke/GCoh/blob/master/simulations/simulated_multichannel_EEG_Gcoh.ipynb">is a notebook illustrating the data scenario:</A> 
:point_left:.  THis link will open up a colab notebook that will generate a simulated EEG dataset, and show the patterns of multichannel neural coherence we can extract from the data.
